<h1>VTS 3.0 <i>Quick Start Guide</i></h1>
<p>Visual Test Shell (VTS) is an application for testing the BACnet
functionality of various devices used in building automation systems.&nbsp;
BACnet is a Data Communication Protocol for Building Automation and Control
Networks developed under the auspices of the American Society of Heating,
Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).&nbsp;&nbsp; For
information on BACnet, see <a href="http://www.bacnet.org">http://www.bacnet.org</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VTS 3.0 is the third generation of VTS.&nbsp; It is a complete redesign and
rewrite of VTS and there are still some features missing and perhaps even a bug
or two.&nbsp; VTS 3.0 has been turned into an open source project in the hopes
that the users of this program will assist in making it a robust and full
featured BACnet test tool.&nbsp; The home of the VTS 3.0 open source project
is&nbsp; <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vts/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/vts/</a>
. </p>
<h2>Platform Requirements</h2>
<p>VTS 3.0 runs on Windows98, Windows NT 4.0 (Service Pack 4), or
Windows2000.&nbsp; It may also work on Windows95 systems, but there may be some
compatibility problems with several system DLLs on Windows95.&nbsp; (WindowsME
has not been tested).</p>

<h2><a name="1">Step 1</a> : Install BACMACNT (if required)</h2>
<p>If you are interested in Ethernet or ARCnet traffic, and you plan to run VTS
on Windows NT (or Windows2000), you need to install BACMACNT - otherwise, you
can skip this step.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1.1</b> Copy the BACMACNT.SYS file into the \WinNT\System32\Drivers
directory</p>
<p><b>1.2</b> Reboot to load the new driver.</p>
<p><b>1.3</b> Run BACREGNT.EXE.</p>
<p><b>1.4</b> Make sure the adapters are properly bound (check mark in front of
adapter name).</p>
<p><b>1.5</b> Reboot if necessary.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="2">Step 2</a> : Install VTS</h2>
<p>VTS requires no installation. You may copy VTS.EXE to a directory of your
choice, or run it from the same directory where it was originally extracted from
the zip archive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="3">Step 3</a> : Run VTS</h2>
<p>Running VTS is as simple as double clicking on the application (VTS.EXE) or
selecting Run from the Start menu and entering <a href="file:///C:/VTS/VTS">C:\VTS\VTS</a>
(assuming that you moved VTS.EXE to the directory C:\VTS).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="4">Step 4</a> : Create a database</h2>
<p><b>4.1</b> Select New from the File menu. You will be presented with the
follow dialog box:</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image02.gif" width="281" height="139"></center></p>
<p>Select VDB, you will be creating a session database. The session database
contains a description of the ports, names bound to addresses, and packets that
were sent or received on each port. VTS allows more than one session database
open at the same time, so it is possible to configure one database for Ethernet
traffic and one for IP and have them both capturing packets at the same time.</p>
<p>The VTS selection is for creating scripts which is not covered in this quick
start guide.</p>
<p><b>4.2</b> Give the session a file name.</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image03.gif" width="426" height="285"></center></p>
<p><b>4.3</b> Identify the split pane view of the session.</p>
<p>You will be presented with a split-pane window with three components:</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image04.gif" width="719" height="521"></center></p>
<p>A description of the three panes is found in <a href="#7">Step 7</a>. This
session window works as you would expect, the Windows menu allows you to manage
multiple views of the same database and tile or stack them. A large monitor is
recommended for multiple windows.</p>
<p><a href="#5">[&nbsp;Next&nbsp;]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="5">Step 5</a> : Create a port</h2>
<p>A port is a communications endpoint that sends and receives packets. Some
ports are associated with a physical interface such as an Ethernet
communications card, and others such as IP ports are associated with a UDP port.</p>
<p><b>5.1</b> Select Ports from the Edit menu. Click on New and give the port a
name. Click on IP and you will see the following dialog box:</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image05.gif" width="399" height="366"></center></p>
<p><b>5.2</b> Click on the Configuration button, you will be presented with a
dialog box for configuring the port. Each port type has its own configuration
options.</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image06.gif" width="287" height="171"></center></p>
<p>For BACnet/IP ports, the socket 0xBAC0 (or 47808) is the typical socket
number. Click OK, then click on the Enable check box.</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image07.gif" width="399" height="366"></center></p>
<p>When a port is enabled it is available for sending and receiving packets. If
the status indicator is red, there is some problem enabling the port and a
description will appear in the status area.</p>
<p><a href="#6">[&nbsp;Next&nbsp;]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="6">Step 6</a> : Send a packet</h2>
<p>The most basic function of VTS is to send and receive packets and decode
them. Click on the Send menu and you will see a menu that looks like this:</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image08.gif" width="719" height="521"></center></p>
<p>The BAC0 name that is selected is the port created in Step 5. There is only
one enabled port, so it is selected by default, and below the port is a
hierarchical menu of families of types of packets. The BVLL menu has BACnet/IP
specific packets such as Register-Foreign-Device. The Network menu contains
BACnet networking packets such as Who-Is-Router-To-Network. The other menus are
common groups of application layer messages.</p>
<p><b>6.1</b> Select Register-Foreign-Device from the BVLL menu. You will be
presented with the following dialog box:</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image09.gif" width="607" height="397"></center></p>
<p>The central feature of the dialog box is a set of tabbed panels, one tab for
each layer in the packet. The Register-Foreign-Device message has only one
parameter, the Time-To-Live. This is a required parameter, as indicated by the
error message in the text area below the panels.</p>
<p><b>6.2</b> Enter a time-to-live in seconds.</p>
<p>When a parameter in the packet contains valid information, other parameters
in other panels are verified to contain correct content.</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image10.gif" width="607" height="397"></center></p>
<p><b>6.3</b> Enter the destination address for the packet by selecting the IP
tab. The destination address may be provided by entering an IP address in the
text area, or selecting a name from the drop down menu.</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image11.gif" width="607" height="397"></center></p>
<p>By selecting TD, a predefined name for each port, the BACnet/IP address of
the PC will be entered into the text area.</p>
<p><b>6.4</b> Click on the Send button.</p>
<p>When the packet is well formed, the encoded content will appear in the text
area below the panels. This may be edited before sending to test how a device
responds to malformed packets. In the session window you will see an indication
of a packet that has been transmitted.</p>
<p><b>6.5</b> Close the Send dialog box.</p>
<p>The Send dialog box is designed to be non-modal, so it is not closed
automatically. The packet contents can be modified and sent again.</p>
<p><a href="#7">[&nbsp;Next&nbsp;]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="7">Step 7</a> : Analyze a packet</h2>
<p>The session window contains three panes. The <b>summary view</b> on the left
has one line per packet and provides general information such as the packet
number, time it arrived, source and destination addresses, and a brief
description of the packet. The <b>detail view</b> in the upper right contains a
complete decoding of the packet contents. The <b>hex view</b> in the lower right
displays the binary content of the packet.</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image13.gif" width="719" height="521"></center></p>
<p><b>7.1</b> Select a row in the detail view.</p>
<p>The three views are synchronized so selecting a detail row will highlight the
hex encoding of that specific portion of the packet.</p>
<p><a href="#8">[&nbsp;Next&nbsp;]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="8">Step 8</a> : Create a name</h2>
<p>A <b>name</b> is a shortcut for an address. Names are used in the source and
destination address areas of ports, as well as the SNET and DNET portion of the
BACnet network layer. Select Names from the Edit menu and you will be presented
with the following dialog box:</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image14.gif" width="486" height="360"></center></p>
<p>Notice that there is already a name TD (common abbreviation for Test Device)
defined and given the address of the port. If this was an Ethernet port, TD
would be the Ethernet address of the port.</p>
<p><b>8.1</b> Click New, change the name to LB, and click on the Local Broadcast
radio button.</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image15.gif" width="486" height="360"></center></p>
<p>This name will now represent a local broadcast address for any port. For an
Ethernet port, this is the address FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF, for an IP port it is the
address 255.255.255.255:47808. Click on the OK button to close the dialog box.</p>
<p><a href="#9">[&nbsp;Next&nbsp;]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="9">Step 9</a> : Send a more complicated packet</h2>
<p>For the next example, send out a global broadcast Who-Is packet.</p>
<p><b>9.1</b> Select Who-Is from the Remote Device Management submenu. You will
be presented with the following dialog box.</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image16.gif" width="607" height="397"></center></p>
<p>The device instance low limit and high limit are optional parameters in the
message. By leaving both fields empty, the request will indicate that all
devices must respond.</p>
<p><b>9.2</b> Select the NPCI tab.</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image17.gif" width="607" height="397"></center></p>
<p>A Who-Is request is usually sent out as a global broadcast, so the DNET is
present and has the value 65535.</p>
<p><b>9.3</b> Select the BVLCI tab.</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image18.gif" width="607" height="397"></center></p>
<p>Assuming the PC is connected to a BACnet/IP network, this message should be
sent out as an original broadcast message.</p>
<p><b>9.4</b> Select the IP tab.</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image19.gif" width="607" height="397"></center></p>
<p>The destination address uses the name LB which has the local broadcast
address for the port filled into the edit box.</p>
<p><b>9.5</b> Click Send, then close the dialog box.</p>
<p><a href="#10">[&nbsp;Next&nbsp;]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="10">Step 10</a> : Analyze the response</h2>
<p>Here is a sample captured from a test network. Note that there seems to be a
problem with many devices sending their I-Am responses multiple times, or that
some intermediate network component is repeating the message.</p>
<p><center><img src="Images/Image20.gif" width="777" height="520"></center></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="#10">[&nbsp;Next&nbsp;]</a></p>
